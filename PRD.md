# MHCIC Solar-First â€“ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement
Current materials (e.g., PDFs) donâ€™t convey the symbolic, ethical, and systemic value of MHCIC. Stakeholders struggle to grasp its decentralised governance model, matched funding impact, and regenerative logic at a glance.

## ðŸ‘¥ User Stories
- As a funder, I want to see the real-world outcomes and governance structure in a simple, visually intuitive way.
- As a partner (e.g., makerspace, NGO), I want to understand where I can slot in and what impact Iâ€™ll have.
- As a curious visitor, I want to intuitively navigate the symbolic structure and discover its meaning.

- Solar-panel-inspired blueprint navigation map
- Loaf-for-Loaf PPP impact calculator
