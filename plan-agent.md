# MHCIC Solar-First – Replit Agent Project Plan

## Project Overview
MHCIC Solar-First is a regenerative civic interface, connecting ethical solar infrastructure with Amazigh-led STEAM education through a UK-based Community Interest Company (CIC). The project demonstrates matched funding, decentralised governance, and narrative-driven transparency.

## Special Terms
- **Loaf-for-Loaf**: A matched funding model based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), using local bread prices as the symbolic unit of equivalence. A donation of 250 MAD in Morocco triggers a matched £250 equivalent in the UK. This model represents moral equity and regenerative reciprocity between contributors.
- **DAO IZM CIC**: A symbolic governance structure complementing the main CIC. Manages participatory governance, cultural legitimacy, and reward logic through decentralised decision tools.
- **Blueprint Navigation**: The site map and UI are designed as a symbolic Earthship-like architectural plan, where each section represents a functional and narrative “chamber” of the project.

## Development Plan
Using the PRD.md and strategy notes, generate a development plan with step-by-step tickets for the following core features:

### 1. Blueprint Navigation (Ticket 1)
- Scaffold index.html with navigation structure based on Earthship-inspired site map.
- Use an interactive SVG or div grid representing project sections (Impact, Governance, Calculator, etc).

### 2. Loaf-for-Loaf Calculator (Ticket 2)
- Build loaf-calculator.html with PPP-based calculation logic.
- User inputs Moroccan contribution, outputs UK match and symbolic impact result.
- Keep design funder-friendly and intuitive.

### 3. DAO IZM Governance Explainer (Ticket 3)
- Develop governance.html to visualise the dual-CIC model.
- Use metaphors like water flow, light storage, and regenerative cycles.

### 4. Impact Stories Page (Ticket 4)
- Build amazigh-impact.html showcasing Mariem’s Heart projects.
- Visual storytelling with images, text, and participatory calls to action.

### 5. Interactive Pitch Deck Viewer (Ticket 5)
- Implement deck.html as a scrollable, interactive version of the strategy document.
- Prioritise clarity for funders and partners.

## Workflow Expectations
- Propose tasks (tickets) with estimated complexity.
- Prioritise regenerative architecture and decentralised governance features.
- Maintain funder-friendly accessibility throughout.
